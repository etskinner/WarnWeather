# Fail when the aplite app image exceeds the launch-safety ceiling.
#
# On aplite the whole image (text+data+bss) loads into the fixed 24 KB app RAM
# and the firmware needs ~2.5 KB of it left to start the process at all. Past
# that, the app SILENTLY never launches: install succeeds, PKJS runs, but the
# watch side never logs, never handshakes, never ACKs — no crash anywhere.
# Measured 2026-07-16 (SDK 4.17 emulator): a 22058 B image boots, 22102 B does
# not, so the hard limit sits in [22058, 22101]. The ceiling below keeps a
# safety margin under that band; if a change trips this check, reclaim image
# bytes on aplite (see docs/adr/0001-aplite-frozen-lean-fork.md for the
# mechanisms) rather than raising the ceiling.

# 21800 -> 21804: the shipped image measured 21804 B (v1.11.0 and the feels-like
# work alike — verified byte-identical against origin/main), i.e. the old ceiling
# had drifted 4 B under what main actually builds and the check was failing on
# unmodified code. Raised to the measured figure, NOT to make room for a change:
# this still leaves ~254 B under the observed 22058 B boot floor, and the rule
# above stands — reclaim bytes rather than raise this again.
