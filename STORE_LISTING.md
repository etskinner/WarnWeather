## Screenshots 

The store wants at least one screenshot per supported platform, so we capture all five
configs on **every** platform (aplite, basalt, diorite, emery, flint) — 5 shots × 5
platforms = 25 files, grouped per platform for upload.

Each config is a fixture bundling its own settings + weather/radar data:

| Label | Config | Fixture |
| ----- | ------ | ------- |
| `1-calendar` | Calendar view, white rain bars, precipitation line, fill off | `store-calendar` |
| `2-radar-multicolor` | Radar view, multicolor radar + rain bars | `berlin` |
| `3-wind-gust` | Wind speed line with dotted gust line | `windy` |
| `4-radar-white-wind` | Radar view (white radar) + yellow wind line with dotted gust | `store-wind-radar` |
| `5-precip-uv` | Precipitation line (filled) with dotted UV index line, multicolor rain bars | `precip-uv` |

`berlin` and `store-wind-radar` auto-tap into the radar view; the others stay on the
calendar/forecast view. On the black-and-white platforms (aplite, diorite, flint) the
multicolor/yellow settings render in B&W — expected.

Capture everything in one go:

```
scripts/capture-store-shots.sh v1.0.0
```

Output lands in `screenshot/v1.0.0/store/<platform>/<label>.png` — e.g.
`store/emery/1-calendar.png`. Upload each platform's five files to that platform in the
store listing.
