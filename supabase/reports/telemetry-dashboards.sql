-- Telemetry dashboards.
--
-- Freshness is the priority: the "currently active" panels read the live raw
-- table so they reflect today, not last night's rollup.
--
-- ⚠ Since app 1.16 events arrive BATCHED (telemetry.js queues ~24 events /
-- ~12 h per watch and posts them as one request; rows carry the client-side
-- event time in received_at). "Live from raw" therefore means "complete up to
-- ~12 h ago, plus whatever has flushed since" — today's counts firm up over
-- the day and finalize with a lag, and a just-released build appears in the
-- version panels hours after its first fetches. Raw retention is 7 days now
-- (not 14): the 14-day-window notes below predate that. Sources by query:
--   • Active-base snapshots (#7, #8, #11, #12, #13, #14) and recent-ops
--     (#2, #3, #4, #5, #6): live from raw public.telemetry_weather_fetch. Raw is
--     retained only 14 days, so these are bounded to that window.
--   • Daily active users (#1), daily trial watches (#15), lifecycle/churn (#9,
--     #10), and today's active split (#16): union — finalized history from the
--     daily rollup (telemetry_dau + telemetry_watch, written by
--     public.telemetry_rollup_and_prune() ~03:00 UTC) plus TODAY AND YESTERDAY
--     live from raw, so neither is stale. telemetry_dau's row for a given UTC day
--     is not finalized until the ~03:00 rollup of the *next* day, so between 00:00
--     and 03:00 UTC yesterday's rollup row still holds only its first ~3 hours;
--     reading yesterday from raw (retained 14 days) avoids that undercount. These
--     never read lifetime_events; the event count is recomputed from telemetry_dau
--     (days before yesterday) + raw.
--   • Top errors (#4): live from raw within its 7-day window (raw keeps the error
--     text 14 days). The telemetry_errors rollup (~7-week retention) is only for
--     error history older than raw.
--
-- "Active watch" = >= 20 events in raw AND last_seen >= now() - interval '1 day'.
-- The watch is watch_key = coalesce(watch_token_hash, account_token_hash). All
-- dates are UTC. Paste each section into a Supabase custom report (Dashboard ->
-- Reports -> New custom report) or run it in the SQL editor.

-- ============================================================
-- 1. Daily active users (last 30 days).
-- count(*) = active watches; count(distinct account_token_hash) = active accounts.
-- telemetry_dau is only rebuilt by the nightly telemetry_rollup_and_prune() cron
-- (~03:00 UTC), and it does not FINALIZE a given UTC day until the run of the
-- *next* day: during the 03:00 run on day D it writes D's row from only the ~3
-- hours seen so far, then finalizes it at 03:00 on D+1. So both the current day
-- AND yesterday can be understated in telemetry_dau (yesterday until tonight's
-- rollup catches up). Compute today and yesterday live from the raw, real-time
-- telemetry_weather_fetch table (retained 14 days) instead; older finalized days
-- still come from telemetry_dau.

-- These count the CURRENTLY-ACTIVE fleet live from raw telemetry_weather_fetch,
-- not last night's rollup snapshot. A watch is "active" when it (a) has >= 20
-- events in the retained raw window — a genuinely-used install, not someone who
-- fired a few fetches and removed it — and (b) fetched within the last day. The
-- unit is the WATCH: watch_token_hash, falling back to account_token_hash when
-- the watch token is null. The 1-day window is deliberately tight (the watchface
-- fetches every 30-60 min, so a day of silence means it's gone); widen the
-- `interval '1 day'` literal to loosen it. Each report is pasted standalone, so
-- the watch_stats / active / latest_per_watch preamble is repeated per query.
