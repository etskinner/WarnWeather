// Where each time font's digits actually ink inside the clock band — the one quantity the
// layout solver cannot derive. The SDK has no ink-bbox call (text_layer_get_content_size
// reports the LINE BOX, and each face relates its ink to that box differently), and the six
// screen x font combinations are genuinely different faces:
//
//   screen   roboto                          leco                        bitham
//   144px    FONT_KEY_ROBOTO_BOLD_SUBSET_49  FONT_KEY_LECO_42_NUMBERS    FONT_KEY_BITHAM_42_MEDIUM_NUMBERS
//   emery    custom Roboto-Bold-62           FONT_KEY_LECO_60_NUMBERS_AM_PM  custom Montserrat-Medium-62
//
// So: six measured pairs. This header is included by main_window.c (which passes the pair to the
// layout solver) and by layers/time_layer.c (which seats the AM/PM label on the digits' ink row)
// — and by nothing else. It depends on config.h, which is exactly why windows/layout.c must not
// reach it: that module's purity is enforced by the host stub (test/c/stub/pebble.h), so the
// metric arrives there as a parameter, not a lookup. For the same reason nothing in this header
// can appear in a host test — it pulls layer_util.h, whose inline bodies call the text API.
//
// ── How these were measured (2026-08-25), so a font change is a re-run and not an eyeball ──
// 1. Fixtures fixtures/clock-cal-{roboto,leco,bitham}.json: the noCal preset, 24h, health and
//    radar off. noCal is the one preset where NOTHING else paints inside the clock band — the
//    strip's ink floor sits above it and the status row's ink top below it — so a plain row scan
//    isolates the digits with no colour tricks and no AM/PM child in the way.
// 2. PLATFORMS="basalt emery" scripts/capture-screenshots.sh cal-<font> clock-cal-<font>
//    (basalt stands in for the whole 144px family: same screen, same three fonts).
// 3. scripts/ink-scan style row scan of the clock band for the first and last inked row.
//    The band is pinned by test/c/layout_test.c's `none.time` golden: (0,16,144,45) on 144px,
//    (2,24,196,60) on emery, i.e. band centres 38 and 54.
// 4. centre_off = (ink_top + ink_h/2) - band_centre, with C truncation — clock_seat_y() inverts
//    it with the same truncation, so the round trip is exact.
// 5. emery ONLY: add 2. The measurement was taken while time_layer.c still applied its
//    MT_TIME_{ROBOTO,LECO,BITHAM} nudge, which was a uniform -2 on emery for all three fonts
//    (it did no per-font work at all, which is why it collapses into one column here). Removing
//    it drops the ink 2 rows.
//
// Digits carry no descenders and every digit spans the full cap height, so the extents do not
// move with the displayed time — with ONE measured exception, found on 2026-08-26 while seating
// the AM/PM label against this table. On 144px BITHAM they do move by a row: the pairs above are
// measured on "10:38", and "12:34" inks rows 24..53 where "10:38" inks 23..53 on the same band —
// one row lower, one row shorter. Both strings contain the "3", so the overshoot above the cap
// line belongs to the "0" and/or the "8"; the flat-topped set has none. The other five
// combinations reproduce their pair exactly on both strings (re-verified on both screens).
// Consequence, and it is not confined to the label — but the two consumers inherit it in
// OPPOSITE directions, so do not "fix" one by nudging the other. For a time with no 0 and no 8
// the table names a row one ABOVE where the ink really starts, while the real ink keeps the same
// bottom row (24..53 against a predicted 23..53). The AM/PM label is seated ON the named row, so
// it reads 1px HIGH of the digits. The clock BAND is seated so that a 31-row ink starting on the
// named row would be symmetric; the real ink loses that top row and keeps its bottom, so it
// gains a blank row above and none below — the digits read 1px LOW. And only on half the
// presets: where clock_seat_y()'s spare row was already parked below (the odd (above+below)
// case, skew == 1 in clock_ink_symmetry), the extra row above lands exactly level and the
// digits come out balanced. Fixing it properly means a per-digit-set metric, which is a bigger
// idea than one row on one font; recorded here so the next person measuring a 1px lean on
// Bitham knows it is this and not their change.
//
// Cross-checks that all passed: the 144px roboto and leco numbers reproduce the independently
// measured fullCal ink in the design spec (63..97 and 65..93) from a DIFFERENT band position,
// which is what confirms centre_off is band-independent; and the resulting gaps reproduce the
// spec's measured table exactly (basalt noCal 9/8, emery noCal 14/14, basalt leco 11/12).
