// Status-bar font metrics and band arithmetic — the SDK-free half of layer_util.h.
//
// Everything here is integer math over a line's MEASURED content height, so it holds for
// any Gothic size with no per-tier tuning. It carries no <pebble.h> dependency on purpose:
// windows/layout.c sizes its status bands from these rules and must stay pure (see
// test/c/stub/pebble.h), and the host tests exercise the seating directly.
// layer_util.h includes this and adds the SDK-facing wrappers that measure a GFont.

// Pebble seats a digit LOW in its line box: the visible glyph (its cap box) sits at the
// BOTTOM of the measured content height. So for a line whose frame top is `text_y` and
// measured height `content_h`:
//     glyph bottom = text_y + content_h
//     glyph centre = glyph bottom - cap/2
// There is no descent term: `content_h` already excludes the font's true descent (see
// status_descender_h below — "0g" measures the same height as "0"), so the baseline IS the
// content-box bottom and the cap box sits directly on it. MEASURED on emulator captures of
// the digits "20kph" / "38" in a status slot, all three status sizes, both platforms:
//
//   font       content_h   cap ink rows   cap   content-bottom -> cap bottom
//   Gothic 14      14          9 rows      9              0
//   Gothic 18      18         11 rows     11              0
//   Gothic 24      24         14 rows     14              0
//
// The cap height is exactly content_h/2 + 2 at all three sizes (slope 1/2 through 9/11/14),
// which is what the two knobs below encode. The retired model — descent content_h/16 plus
// cap 5*content_h/9 — was wrong at every size (it predicted cap 7.8 / 10.0 / 13.3 and a
// nonzero descent); the two errors cancelled to the half-pixel at 14/18 but left the
// Gothic-24 centre a full pixel high, which is emery's only status size and showed up as a
// visibly off-centre threshold-highlight box.

// Rows the TOP STRIP — and only the top strip — seats its content ABOVE the cap-centred
// position status_seat_y() gives it. A taste knob, in the same family as
// STATUS_FORECAST_CLEARANCE / MT_TIME: it buys visible air, it is not derived from the font.
//
// Why the strip alone is exempt from cap-centring: its top edge IS the screen's top edge
// (LAYOUT_PAD_TOP is 0 on the 144px watches), so nothing renders in the air a centred cap
// leaves above it — that air is simply wasted. The air BELOW the line is the gap the eye
// reads, down to the calendar's first row. Moving the line up therefore converts invisible
// margin into visible separation.
//
// Why the SEAT and not the band: shrinking the strip's BAND moves everything anchored to it up
// by exactly as much, so the gap is conserved and nothing is won (measured: 2 -> 2 blank rows;
// see the reverted 7da5424). Lifting inside an unchanged band is the only move that opens it.
//
// What the lift now also moves: windows/layout.c anchors the calendar band to the strip's INK
// (status_strip_ink_h below), not to its band, so this constant is load-bearing for calendar_y
// — a bigger lift raises the calendar with the line, keeping the calendar's first painted row on
// the strip's first unpainted one. That is the point: the rows the lift frees at the band's
// bottom are handed to the calendar→status gap instead of becoming dead air. Everything BELOW
// the calendar (clock, status rows, forecast) anchors to CALENDAR_STATUS_HEIGHT and is untouched
// by the lift either way.
//
// Why 2: it is the largest lift EITHER screen size can take, which is why one shared constant
// serves both. Gothic 18 seats its cap centre at band_h/2 = 8 in the 17px band with a MEASURED
// cap of 11 px, so the cap occupies rows 3..13; a lift of 2 puts it on rows 1..11 (1 px of
// margin) and a lift of 3 would put its first row flush on row 0. emery lands on the same
// bound: Gothic 24 centres a MEASURED 14px cap on rows 3..16 of its 21px band, so a lift of 2
// gives rows 1..14 and 3 would again reach row 0. Descenders stay inside the band either way —
// at the clamp-free height the centred line's tails exactly reach the band bottom, and the
// lift carries them up with the line, leaving STATUS_TOP_STRIP_LIFT spare rows beneath them
// (verified in test/c/layout_test.c::seating_no_lift).
//
// Accepted consequences: the strip's cap is no longer centred in its band, and the
// threshold-highlight box, which clamps symmetrically about the cap (status_highlight_extent),
// comes out 2 * STATUS_TOP_STRIP_LIFT shorter. Both are deliberate.
#define STATUS_TOP_STRIP_LIFT 2

// Blank rows layout.c leaves between the strip's ink floor and the calendar's first
// painted row. The 168px watches have no rows to spare (their calendar-view gaps run
// 3-5 px) so the calendar keeps sitting directly ON the ink floor; emery's audit showed
// 7-9 px gaps everywhere else, so it spends 2 of them here — giving the strip's
// threshold-highlight box room to house a descender tail INSIDE its outline and
// guaranteeing a filled danger slot never merges with the calendar's weekend/today
// highlight (both MEASURED complaints, 2026-08-15). Shared here because TWO consumers
