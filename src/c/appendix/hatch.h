// ── Height-scaled stride ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A 45° hatch line reads as a short slash in a band wider than it is tall, and the
// horizontal gap between adjacent slashes is exactly `stride` px. The bottom band's
// height varies ~1.7x across layout presets, so a fixed stride gives a taller graph MORE
// equally-tight slashes. Scaling the stride with the plot height instead gives a bigger
// graph FEWER, wider-spaced lines.
//
// The tuning knob. 100 = the stride grows in direct proportion to the plot height (a plot
// twice the baseline height gets twice the stride). Lower values damp the effect; 0
// disables it entirely (constant stride, the pre-scaling behaviour). Tuned visually on
// the emulator — retuning it invalidates test/c/hatch_stride_test.c's goldens on purpose.
//
// What 100 actually buys: it holds the ABSOLUTE DOT COUNT roughly constant as the band
// grows (ink fraction is 1/stride, so a ~1.9x taller band needs a ~1.9x wider stride to
// match — ~526 dots at plot 41/stride 6 vs. ~539 at plot 77/stride 11, for a typical
// 77px-wide night band). It does NOT hold the SLASH COUNT constant: slashes across a WxH
// region number ~(W+H)/stride, so the tall preset ends up with ~14 slashes vs. ~20 in the
// baseline preset — normalising by height alone overshoots "same number of lines" because
// perceived count depends on W+H, not H alone. If visual sign-off says the tall presets
// look too sparse, the slash-count-preserving value is ~100*H0/(W+H0) ≈ 35, not a small
// nudge off 100.

// The baseline plot height: the height AT WHICH scaling begins — at or below it the
// stride is exactly its unscaled base value. This is the forecast band in the tightest
// preset (fullCal / compactDense) minus its chrome — band 51 - BOTTOM_VIEW_AXIS_H 10 on
// the 168px watches; band 68 - BOTTOM_VIEW_BOTTOM_PAD 10 - AXIS_H 10 on emery. The band
// heights are the goldens pinned by test/c/layout_test.c (`full.bottom`); if those ever
// change, these follow. Shorter plots do exist — the Timeline Quick View peek layout
// (layout_compute_peek) draws forecast plots well below this baseline — they simply
// clamp to the base stride like any other sub-baseline height (see
// hatch_stride_scaled() below).

// Bare hatch-dot emitter: no B&W backing, ever — see hatch_fill_rect() below for

// (pixels at (x + y) % stride == 0), unconditionally.
//
// Exposed for chart.c's B&W area-fill dither (chart_render_area): that dither IS
// a stride-2 hatch pass, and hatch_fill_rect()'s per-dot backing square would
// paint over half the checkerboard it's building rather than clean it up — the
// backing is for a sparse overlay dot, not a dense 50% fill pattern. Everything
// else should call hatch_fill_rect() instead.

// Fill a rect with a 1-px diagonal hatch using graphics_draw_pixel.
//
// Sets the stroke color on ctx to 'color', then paints pixels at all
// positions where (x + y) % stride == 0, using layer-relative
// coordinates. Adjacent rects within the same layer produce a visually
// continuous pattern because the parity check is based on absolute
// layer coords, not rect-relative ones.
//
// 'stride' is the pixel spacing between hatch dots. Both the forecast night-shading
// (NIGHT_HATCH_SPACING) and the radar area-bar background (RADAR_HATCH_SPACING) derive
// it from their live plot height via hatch_stride_scaled() above: a base of 6 on
// effectively-color builds / 7 on B&W at the baseline height, growing for taller plots.
// Exception: on aplite, NIGHT_HATCH_SPACING is frozen at the constant base stride instead
// (no radar there to keep in step with) — see forecast_layer.c.
//
// In any B&W theme (theme_is_bw() — TRUE both for a color build's bw/bw-light theme
// AND, constant-true, on real B&W hardware: see theme.h), each dot additionally gets
// a theme_bg() backing: a 1px-wide vertical run one pixel above and below the dot (its
// own column only), so a sparse fg dot reads over whatever it lands on (an area fill, a
// bar) instead of blending into it — same reasoning as chart.c's chart_draw_bar_dots
// (Fix 3): the backing is a no-op wherever the dot already sits on background (bg over
// bg changes nothing). The run stays in the dot's column on purpose — a square backing's
// horizontal spill would erase the diagonal's neighbouring-column dots (see hatch.c).
// Unlike
// chart_render_area's checkerboard dither (color-hardware-only: real B&W hardware
// already dithers a flat fill in silicon), this backing is not something real
// hardware gets "for free" — a hand-drawn fg dot there is just as easy to lose over
// a fill/bar as it is on a color build's bw theme, so it applies everywhere
// theme_is_bw() is true.
//
// No-op if stride <= 0 or rect has zero/negative width or height.
