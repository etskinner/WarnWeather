// Why a shared TOP and not a shared bottom overhang: the band above it — the calendar — is
// preset-independent (same cal_h, same rows, same font in every compact preset), so the
// clearance the eye reads under the calendar is decided purely by where the status band's TOP
// lands. Anchoring the BOTTOM instead made that clearance vary with the band's own height and
// font: a LONE row takes STATUS_LARGE_BAND_H at the large font, a DUAL takes the shorter
// calendar_h/3 at the smaller full-tier font, and only the lone case carried the nudge — so the

// to the gap: they now only decide how much of the row's own air sits BELOW its ink, which is
// spent on the clock band's blank top margin where nothing is drawn.
