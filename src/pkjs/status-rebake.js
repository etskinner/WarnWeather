// src/pkjs/status-rebake.js — re-send the status category WITHOUT a fetch,
// from remembered bake inputs.
//
// The forecast pipeline hands its bake inputs here immediately before
// buildStatusLines (rememberBakeInputs); any later trigger — today a
// phone-battery event, tomorrow anything else with a phone-side value in a
// status slot — re-bakes those inputs against the CURRENT settings and pushes
// only the status keys (resendStatus). A version-stamped flash snapshot backs
// the in-memory inputs across PKJS restarts (PKJS dies whenever the user
// leaves the watchface).
//
// This lived inside phone-battery.js, which inverted a dependency — the
// weather pipeline (forecast-series.js) had to require a BATTERY module just
// to stash bake inputs — and forced lazy-require contortions around the
// status-lines cycle. The load graph here is clean: status-lines' only edge
// back to phone-battery is lazy, and outbox has no path back at all, so both
// are plain top-level requires.

// The micro-send mechanics: `buildStatusLines()` runs inside the
// forecast bake and consumes transient payload keys that are deleted right
// after, so a re-bake needs the bake *inputs*: forecast-series.js hands them
// over via rememberBakeInputs() immediately before the bake. On a battery
// event we re-bake a fresh clone of that snapshot and push only the five
// status keys through the normal outbox. change-detector's categorySubset()
// returns null for a category whose keys are all absent and ChangeDetector
// skips those outright, so a partial payload sends the 'status' category alone
// — no new outbox API, and no fetch, which is the point: a user with an
// expired provider key still gets a live reading.
//
// The snapshot lives in memory AND on flash. Memory is the fast path;
// localStorage is the restart backstop, and the backstop is not optional. PKJS
// is torn down every time the user leaves the watchface, so an in-memory-only
// snapshot left this slot dead from every restart until the next COMPLETED
// fetch -- up to fetchIntervalMin (default 15, max 60 minutes), longer when
// fetches fail. Every charging event inside that window logged "no bake
// snapshot yet" and reached the watch not at all, which is exactly the event a
// user looks at the watch to confirm.
//
// Why re-baking a RESTORED snapshot is safe -- verified against
// forecast-series.js (applyForecastSeries) and status-lines.js:
//
//   * The snapshot is rewritten at EVERY bake (rememberBakeInputs runs
//     immediately before buildStatusLines), and the status lines the watch has
//     on flash came from the send that carried that same bake. So a re-bake
//     reproduces the text the watch is ALREADY displaying for every slot but
//     the battery one.
//   * Every weather-derived slot (temp/feels, city, uv, wind, gust, pressure,
//     dew, aqi, pollen, plus the wind-direction sentinel byte) and the packed
//     STATUS_LEVELS_UINT8 threshold byte read frozen payload values, so they
//     re-bake byte-identically however old the snapshot is.
//   * The `sun` slot formats the epoch frozen in SUN_EVENTS, not the clock, so
//     an old snapshot re-renders the identical string -- stale in precisely the
//     way the watch is already stale, never differently stale.
//   * Three things DO read the clock during a bake, and all three re-derive
//     FORWARD rather than going stale: the countdown slot (formatCountdown
//     defaults `now` to new Date()), aplite's phone-baked ISO week ('W' +
//     isoWeek(new Date())), and the LIVE_* kinds (date, week, hr, steps,
//     distance), which carry no baked text at all -- the watch draws them
//     itself from the kind byte. A snapshot restored across midnight therefore
//     pushes "3d" where the watch still shows "4d": the value the next fetch
//     would have pushed anyway, a correction and never stale text.
//   * Settings are deliberately NOT part of the stored blob. The restored
//     payload is paired with the LIVE settings (deps.getSettings) at re-bake
//     time, which is both smaller and more correct: saving settings forces a
//     fetch, so in the steady state the two agree, and in the brief window where
//     they don't, the live blob is what the next fetch would bake with.
//
// The blob is version-stamped and shape-checked on the way back in, so one
// written by an older build (different key set) degrades to "no snapshot"
// instead of throwing inside a battery event handler.
