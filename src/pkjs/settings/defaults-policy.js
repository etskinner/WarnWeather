// src/pkjs/settings/defaults-policy.js — ES5, WebView + Node. The one place that
// answers "what does this setting default to when the answer depends on something?".
//
// A default has three possible homes, and only the third one is here:
//
//   1. schema.js `defaultValue` — the same on every install and every watch
//      (swapClockStatus, the bold modes, the threshold toggles). Nothing to
//      decide, so nothing to write down here: edit the schema item.
//   2. schema.js `defaultFrom` — resolved per watch at hydrate/bake time by a
//      named resolver. The status slots use this: the catalog knows which watch
//      has a heart-rate sensor, so the slot asks it instead of guessing.
//      config-ui/lib/defaults.js deliberately never seeds these.
//   3. THIS TABLE — a default that only applies in a SITUATION: first-time setup
//      finishing, a capability the watch has, an option the user just picked.
//      None of that can be read off a schema item, so it is written down once,
//      declaratively, in one list you can scroll through.
//
// The table is data, not logic. Every row says WHEN it applies, WHAT it sets, and
// — the part that makes the file worth opening — WHY, in a sentence you can
// disagree with. Adding a conditional default is adding a row, never adding an
// `if` somewhere else. Nothing here is applied on its own: a caller reads its
// context's values (resolveDefaults) or has them written onto live state through
// applyDefaults — the ONE interpreter of the execution vocabulary below, shared
// by the wizard finish and the threshold reset so the semantics cannot fork.
//
// THE `when` VOCABULARY (an unlisted key throws — a typo must not read as a
// condition that quietly never matches):
//
//   wizard: true|false   the first-run wizard is finishing. `false` is a real
//                        condition, not "don't care": omit the key for that.
//   health: true|false   the watch HAS health (env.health) AND the user has not
//                        switched it off (choices.healthMode !== 'off'). Both
//                        halves matter — aplite cannot do health at all, and on a
//                        watch that can, 'off' means the slots would be dead.
//   hr / radar /         plain env capability flags, as computeEnv reports them
//   thresholds /         (config-ui/lib/platform.js). Missing env reads as
//   color / round /      "not capable", which is the safe direction: it can only
//   themePolarity        withhold a default, never place a dead one.
//   platform: 'basalt' | ['chalk', 'basalt']      one name or a list
//   platformNot: 'aplite' | ['aplite']            the complement of the above
//   choice: {key: 'value'} | {key: ['a', 'b']}    what the user picked/stored;
//                        an unset choice matches nothing (except via `health`,
//                        which knows healthMode's schema default).
//
// A row may also carry `seedVia` — see the wizard AQI row for what it is for —
// `dependsOn` (dependent key -> anchor key of the same set), which couples
// writes that only make sense together — see the health-slots row — and
// `overrules` (a list of the rule's own set keys), which exempts a key from the
// consumer's "the user has not spoken here" guard: the rule's value replaces
// even a hand-customized stored one. applyDefaults below is the one interpreter
// of all three. Tests pin that every dependsOn/overrules name references the
// same rule's set, so a typo fails loudly instead of silently stranding a
// dependent or protecting nothing.
(function () {
    // healthMode's schema default (schema.js). Repeated here because an unset
    // healthMode means "the user never touched it", which is health ON, and a
