// src/pkjs/phone-battery.js
//
// The phone's own battery charge, as a status-slot value.
//
// There is no PebbleKit JS API for this. It works on Android only, and only
// because of what the companion app runs PKJS *inside*: a Chromium WebView,
// whose live `navigator` carries the Battery Status API. On iOS PKJS runs in
// JavaScriptCore against a hand-built `navigator` ({userAgent, geolocation,
// language}), and pypkjs (the emulator) injects only `language`/`geolocation` —
// so on both of those every `typeof` guard below falls through and this module
// is inert. `typeof navigator.getBattery === 'function'` therefore doubles as
// the Android/iOS discriminator; no extra signal is needed.
//
// This module owns the whole dependency: detection, subscription, bucketing,
// the persisted cache the baker reads, and the resend trigger. Nothing else in
// the codebase touches `navigator`.
//
// Two numbers, two jobs — do not collapse them back into one. The 5-point
// BUCKET is the SEND TRIGGER and nothing else: a resend fires only when it
// moves (or charging flips), which is the deliberate BLE-wake-up budget. The
// cached LEVEL the baker renders is the EXACT percentage, rewritten on every
// reading, so whenever a send does go out the number on the watch is the
// phone's real charge: 31 % reads "31%", not the bucket's "30%". Using the
// bucket for both jobs is what shipped first, and it threw away accuracy the
// phone already had in hand for no saving whatsoever.
//
// The resend itself is status-rebake.js's job: forecast-series hands it the
// bake inputs before every bake, and this module only pulls the trigger
// (statusRebake.resendStatus). The full why-a-restored-re-bake-is-byte-safe
// rationale lives in that module's header now.
//
// One deliberate consequence of the backstop: the FIRST reading after a restart
// can now send, because the trigger baseline is still in-memory only and so
// counts as a move. That is a refresh, not spam -- the outbox's change detector
// drops a status category whose bytes match the last send outright, so it wakes
// the radio only when the phone's charge really did change while PKJS was down.
//
// ES5 only (aplite's JavaScriptCore) — var + function, and never *construct* a
// Promise. `getBattery()` hands back a host-provided thenable; calling .then()
// on it is fine.

 *   weather fetch, so an untriggered 31 % still reaches the watch on the next
 *   ordinary send instead of being frozen at the last bucket's number.
 * - TRIGGER, rarely. A resend fires only when the 5-point bucket moves, or on

 *   to confirm. That cadence is a deliberate BLE-wake-up budget: caching a
 *   reading costs nothing, sending one wakes the radio.

 * The bucket baseline is in memory only, deliberately, and the SEED reading that
 * establishes it never sends (see subscribe). Both halves matter now that the
 * snapshot survives a restart: PKJS is torn down every time the user leaves the
 * watchface, so a seed that counted as a bucket move would push a micro-send on
 * essentially every visit — the charge is almost always a percent off the last
 * one — and that is exactly the BLE spend the 5-point bucket exists to avoid.
 * A seed is therefore cached (the baker reads the cache on the next fetch) and
 * baselined, and nothing more; the first REAL event afterwards sends normally,
